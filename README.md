# Coffee-Machine
100 Days of Python - Final Beginner Project

This is one of my more advanced beginner projects in python that I coded completely from scratch. 
There is feedback for myself at the top for future projects. 

Summary:
This project prompts user for what they would like to order, turning the coffee machine off, printing a report, check if resources are sufficient,
process coins, check if transaction was successful, and make cofee.
